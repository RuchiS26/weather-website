This Weather Application shows us the real time data of weather forecast of the regions that you search for.

Exploring the asynchronous nature of Node.js.
In here we are learning how to use the asynchronous programming to make HTTP API requests to third-party HTTP APIs. Pulling in the data through a real time weather data.

We are creating this sample project to understand how this works.
Input fields are given where user can enter the location name and the application makes the API request and pulls in data through a real-time weather data.
use command npm run dev or npm start in the terminal to make the code running.

This application was also deployed on heroku - https://rchi-weather-website.herokuapp.com/
